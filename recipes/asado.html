    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Asado de puerco</strong>, or asado de boda, is a classic of
      Northern Mexico. Rich chiles that aren't too hot, lots of pork and some
      super cool spices make up this dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asado de puerco exists all over the northern part of Mexico and has lots
      of interpretations, depending on where you are, and who's cooking it. The
      recipe is slightly different in Nuevo Leon from Sonora, and it changes in
      Durango and Chihuahua, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll also see the dish called asado de boda, because it's one of the
      traditional wedding dishes in that part of the country. And slide over to
      Sinaloa, and you'll see chilorio, which, while not the same dish, is
      similar. (Chilorio tends to be shredded.)

    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pounds pork shoulder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>3 Avocado leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cup lard, bacon fat or oil</li>
      <li>100 grams dried guajillo chiles</li>
      <li>100 grams dried pasilla or ancho chiles</li>
      <li>10 grams arbol or cascabel chiles</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>5 crushed cloves</li>
      <li>1/8 to 1/4 avocado pit</li>
      <li>Zest of an orange</li>
      <li>Juice of an orange</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the pork into chunks between 1 and 2 inches across. Just barely
        cover with water and bring this to a simmer. Skim any froth. Add salt to
        taste and the avocado leaves and simmer uncovered until the water has
        almost cooked away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, pour boiling water over the guajillo, ancho and arbol chiles
        and let them steep to rehydrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        When they're soft, add the chiles, the garlic, cumin, thyme, cloves and
        avocado pit to a blender. Add some water or stock and puree. You want
        this to be about as thick as melted ice cream or housepaint.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the water is almost all gone, remove the avocado leaves and add the
        lard. Turn the heat to medium-high and brown the pork, stirring often.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pork has browned, pour in a little water or stock and use a
        wooden spoon to remove any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Now
        pour in the contents of the blender and stir. Add a little water to the
        blender to get any good stuff out of it and add that to the pot, too.
        Return the avocado leaves to the pot, add the orange juice and zest and
        salt everything to taste. Let this simmer until the sauce thickens a
        bit, about 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve alongside rice and beans, or in a corn tortilla.</li>
    </ol>
